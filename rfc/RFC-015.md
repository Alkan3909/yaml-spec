# RFC-015 -- Empty values not allowed as mapping keys

YAML currently allows empty values in lots of places.
They are meant to be typed as null values.

The null value isn't really useful or common as a mapping key
If it is used it should be explicit:
```
null: foo
```

This will make parsers easier to write and avoid unintended bad YAML being valid.
For instance, now just `:` means same as `null: null`.
That's bad from a language perspective.
OTOH, nulls as values are very common and an empty string should continue to work for that.

## Discussion

* Since equal keys are disallowed, there may be at most one empty key in a mapping anyway.
  Requiring that to be explicit does not hurt anyone and probably improves usability (because it can lead to unintended effects if the writer is not aware). -- flyx
* For 2.0 / 1.5 I would even go further and say *„an empty scalar must be quoted“*.
  This improves readability and is similar to empty mappings / sequences being required to be explicit (`[]` / `{}`).
  However, that would break too much for 1.3. -- flyx
* Since this is not explicitly mentioned in the RFC, I assume `"":` is still valid. -- flyx
