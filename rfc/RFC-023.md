**NOTE**: This is a minimal writeup and should be expanded:

From IRC:
```
ingy | flyx: I had an idea for 1.3 annotation interpolation
ingy | my suggestion is to allow "\{...}" in double quoted strings. THis is currently an error.
ingy | Ruby (and CoffeeScript and others) use "#{...}", Perl6 uses "{...}" and Perl5 uses "${\...}"
ingy | Where ... is an expression
ingy | Regarding annotations as a whole in 1.3, I lean towards keeping them not avaliable as a default, but allowing them as a well supported option.
