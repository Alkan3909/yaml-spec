# RFC-017 -- Disallow colon at the end of plain scalars

## Problem

YAML 1.2 forbids colons at the end of plain scalars for almost every case.

[7.3.3. Plain Style][1]:

    [130] ns-plain-char(c) ::=   ( ns-plain-safe(c) - “:” - “#” )
    | ( /* An ns-char preceding */ “#” )
    | ( “:” /* Followed by an ns-plain-safe(c) */ )

There is one exception - if a colon (as an indicator of a mapping key) follows
it, then it's valid:

    ---
    key with two colons::: value

Although most frameworks can parse this, it's not especially readable.
Also, the value "foo::" has to be quoted in every other place.
It's only valid without quotes if it's a mapping key (directly after it).

## Proposal

Change the rule for plain scalars to always forbid colons the end.
