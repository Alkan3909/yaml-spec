RFC-029 -- Maximum 8 spaces per indentation level
=================================================

## Status

Proposed for 1.3.

## Problem

YAML 1.2 allows an arbitrary number of spaces for each indentation level.

This was never considered because it seems like a normal thing to do.

On the other hand, using large indentation levels is not something people want or use in an indentation based language.

It can potentially be used to for security exploits; even if they are only intended to fool people.

The best practice for writing YAML is 2 spaces.
This is the defacto default for all dumpers.

#### Proposal

YAML will only allow 8 spaces per indentation level.

This could be set higher for YAML 1.3 as long as a deprecation warning existed that it would be 8 one day.
