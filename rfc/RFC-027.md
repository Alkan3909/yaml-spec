# RFC-027 -- Remove multiline flow scalars in blocks

## Problem

(This proposal would break too much to go into 1.3)

I guess Flow Scalars are called flow, because they can flow around its parent node.

```
# example 1
flow1:
  a
  b
  c

#example 2
flow2: a
  b
  c

---
# example 3
- a
  b
  c

# example 4
- a
 b
 c
```

As you can see, in example 2, the lines of the flow scalar flow around the mapping key and are not all indented the same.
I find example 1 much more readable.

I first thought that you could just forbid example 2 and 4.
But then, I see no reason why one would not simply use block scalars for all multiline scalars.
This would also eliminate examples like this which look like a badly indented sequence:

```
- one sequence
 - item
# same as
- "one sequence - item"
```

Using a block scalar makes it unambiguous.

## Proposal

Remove multiline scalars.
Plain and quoted scalars are restricted to one line.

To support multline scalars with escape sequences, we'd need [RFC-026](RFC-026.md).

It would be very strict, and example 3 would require an extra line.
But strictness is a good thing, as we learn from YAML 1.* that it's very hard to be stricter than previous versions without breaking things.

## Examples

```
plain: this is allowed
single: 'this also'
double: "and this"

literal: |
  multiline has
  to be a block
literal escapes: |"
  and you can also
  use \t escapes
```

However, in flow collections, we probably should still support multiline flow scalars:

```
flow: [
  "a long string
   seperated into
   multiple lines",
  item2, item3
 ]
```
