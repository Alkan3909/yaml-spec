# RFC-012 -- Remove wiki-like syntax from folded block scalars

## Status

Proposed for 1.3.

## Problem

Currently, if a folded block scalar contains *more indented lines*, the line breaks around them are not folded.
This is a surprising feature that is probably never used on purpose.
It also makes parsing more complicated, and needlessly so.

## Proposal

* Define that line folding happens for all lines in a folded block scalar regardless of their indentation.
* Treat any leading and trailing whitespace as part of line folding, regardless of whether the line is more indented than the scalar's indentation.
* Any line that only contains whitespace is considered to be an empty line even if it contains more spaces that the scalar's indentation.
* Folded block scalars may not have an explicit indentation indicator.
   The indentation is always defined by the first non-empty line.

## Consequences

* Folded scalars may no longer start with whitespace.
* Folded scalars may no longer end with whitespace.
* It is possible to further indent content without suddenly having a very different semantics applied.
  This is useful for example for breaking long bash commands into multiple lines and indenting the subsequent lines.

## Examples

```yaml
# input:
--- >
 one
   two
 three
 four
  five
  six
 seven

 eight
# output with old rule:
--- !!str
"one\n  two\nthree four\n five\n six\nseven\neight\n"
# output with new rule:
--- !!str
"one two three four five six seven\neight\n"
```

```
# not allowed:
--- >1
  foo
```
