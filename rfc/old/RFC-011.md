# RFC-011 -- Top level literal nodes must be indented

## Status

Proposed for 1.3.


## Problem

Currently, it is possible to have a block scalar at top level with zero indentation:

```yaml
--- |
foo
bar
---
```

This makes parsing the block scalar complicated since the parser needs to look for `---` and `...` which would end it although they are not indented less than the scalar.

Another strange thing is that since the parent indentation level of the root node is specified as `-1`, this piece of YAML:

```yaml
--- |1
 foo
```

will parse to:

```yaml
--- !!str
" foo\n"
```

Which is clearly not what was intended.
This happens because `-1 [parent indentation] + 1 [explicitly given indentation] = 0`.

One of the primary use cases for the literal scalar is that any YAML document could itself be encoded as a scalar in another YAML document simply by indenting it.

So the YAML document:
```
---
foo: bar
```

Could be encoded into another YAML doc like this:
```
--- |
  ---
  foo: bar
```

With no indentation, the meaning changes:
```
--- |
---
foo: bar
```

It also stands to reason that encoding a value into any format involves some noticeable change to the original.
Without indentation it's hard to know what is what.


## Proposed Changes

* Every top level block scalar (literal or folded) must have an indentation of at least one space.
* When calculating the indentation of a block scalar with explicit indentation indicator, the actual indentation shall be calculated by `max(0, parent_indentation) + indentation_indicator`.

## Notes

Not all YAML frameworks support zero indent.

LibYAML already implements the indentation indicator as if it was defined with the `max` syntax proposed for this RFC.

## Examples

```yaml
# input:
--- |1
  foo
# result:
--- !!str
" foo\n"
```

```yaml
# not allowed
--- |
foo
```

## Comments

* @perlpunk changed her mind and thinks it might be useful to have zero indented block scalars, for documents like markdown or pod, for example.
  (The only problem is the indentation indicator which is implemented IMHO inconsistently by most parsers for zero-indented block scalars.) 2018-03-01
