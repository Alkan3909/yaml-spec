# RFC-024 -- Explicit external aliases

This is a followup to [RFC-009](RFC-009.md)

Allowing to use external variables that are passed to the processor would be really useful.

RFC 9 suggests that any alias that can't be resolved locally should be tried to resolve with external variables.

A concern with that approach is that it's not obvious when looking at a YAML document, if an alias is supposed to be local or external.
When it has a typo, it's even more difficult.
And an alias meant to be internal can suddenly become external by a typo.

## TODO

Define how an external alias should look like

```
- *!var # mnemonic for (ex)plicit, (ex)ternal
- **var
- *@var # would fit better for @@annotation variables
- *|var
- *?var
- *#var
- *$var
- *%var
- *^var
- *+var
- *:var
- *!(var) # this one could (in the future) contain simple path expressions, like *!(env.HOME)
```

What should happen if there is no external variable with that name?

The YAML 1.2 spec doesn't say what should happen if a tag is not found, it depends on the implementation; so maybe this could be an option for aliases too, if it should just resolve to `null` or result in an error.
