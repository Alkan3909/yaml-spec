# RFC-007 -- Disallow flow collections as implicit keys

## Status

Proposed for 1.3.

## Proposal

Flow structures used as mapping keys must be explicitly marked with '? '.
The only exception is inside flow mappings.
This is a change from 1.2 where they are allowed.
Doing this allows us to not impose limits on implicit keys.

## Examples
```yaml
# Not allowed:
[1, 2]: 3
# Allowed:
? [1, 2]
: 3
# or:
{ [1, 2]: 3 }
```

```yaml
# Not allowed:
[ [1, 2]: 3 ]
# Allowed:
[ ? [1, 2]: 3 ]
```

## Rationale

In the first place, collections as keys is a very rare occurence.
Also all dumpers would almost certainly use the explicit form.
So we are really not losing anything important in the language, and we are adding the ability to make parsing much simpler.
