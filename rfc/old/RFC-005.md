# RFC-005 -- Restrict default implicit types to JSON semantics

## Status

Proposed for 1.3.

## Problem

YAML has the fundamental concept that unquoted scalars have implicit typing that occurs according to pattern matching.
There are default implicit types and people can register their own patterns and types (if their YAML framework supports it).

## Proposal

This RFC wants to minimize the default implicit typing to be the same as JSON:
Numbers (base 10 integers and floating point), Boolean (true, false) and Null
(null).

Even though it's not part of the spec, YAML has a [Type Repository](http://yaml.org/type/) that specifies dozens of implicit types.
To date, many YAML framework implementations have used these types; often in incomplete and incompatible ways.

Currently implicits include:

* 22 values for true and false
* 5 values for null
* Binary octal hexadecimal and sexagecimal support
* Timestamps and others.

The YAML founders long ago agreed that the implicit typing of plain scalars
should be limited the the JSON semantics.

## To Do

We need to deprecate the YAML type repository and mark all the web pages as such.

We should reach out to existing 1.1 and 1.2 framework authors and encourage them to deprecate this old usage.

We should blog about this and notify the YAML mailing list.
