# RFC-006 -- Disallow carriage return as a break

## Status

Proposed for 1.3.

## Proposal

The YAML 1.2 productions for a line break are:
```
b-break ::= ( b-carriage-return b-line-feed )   /* DOS, Windows */
            | b-carriage-return                 /* MacOS upto 9.x */
            | b-line-feed                       /* UNIX, MacOS X */
b-line-feed ::= #xA          /* LF */
b-carriage-return ::= #xD    /* CR */
```

Since MacOS 9.x is well in the past, we can drop CR as a break token.

A CR not immediately followed by an LF char should be an error; since CR is now
just another non-printable character that is not allowed in YAML.

## 1.3 Rationale

This can go into YAML 1.3 immediately.
It should not break any existing YAML.
