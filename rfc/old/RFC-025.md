# RFC-025 -- Fix Regexp for Floats in JSON Schema

## Problem

The Regular Expression for Floating Points in the JSON Schema does not match the one for JSON:

YAML: [10.2.2. Tag Resolution](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2804356)

```
-? ( 0 | [1-9] [0-9]* ) ( \. [0-9]* )? ( [eE] [-+]? [0-9]+ )?
```

JSON: The rule on http://json.org/ is equivalent to this regex:
```
-? ( 0 | [1-9] [0-9]* ) ( \. [0-9]+ )? ( [eE] [-+]? [0-9]+ )?
```

So there must be at least one digit after the dot.
This should be fixed for 1.3.
