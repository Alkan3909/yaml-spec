# RFC-004 -- Disallow TAB as YAML syntax whitespace character

## Status

Proposed for 1.3.

## Proposal

YAML has never allowed the hard TAB character `#x9` to be used for indentation.
The YAML 1.2 spec defines the whitespace production for whitespace to include both the SPACE `#x20` caharacter and the TAB:
```
[33] s-white ::= s-space | s-tab
```

That means the TAB can show up in very strange places, like after the dash '-' at the beginning of a block sequence entry.

There is no good reason to support/allow TAB characters as YAML syntax, so we should simply remove it from the whitespace production.

We *do* need to allow the TAB in scalar content, but only in the literal form.
The standard example is someone encoding a Makefile as a YAML scalar.

## 1.3 Rationale

Probably nobody is aware that the TAB character is allowed and nobody is using it.
Let's tighten this down ASAP.
