YAML Spec RFCs
==============

The planning for the upcoming versions of the YAML Specification is being facilitated by public Request For Comment (RFC) documents.
Currently the [YAML core group](#yaml-core-group) is working on YAML versions 1.5 and 2.0.
All RFC documents, regardless of their intended target version, will reside in this directory.

## RFC Process

RFCs start out as GitHub Pull Requests (PRs).
Each PR is reviewed by the core team to make sure it is something that should be under consideration.

When an RFC is approved by the core team it is merged to the yaml-spec master branch.
At that point it is assigned a permanent RFC # and has a document that lives in the RFC directory.

Anyone is welcome to submit an RFC as a PR, but it might make sense to file an issue to discuss it first.
The core group has about 50 ideas that are being worked into RFCs; these are being submitted as proposals, which may get initially merged with little public discussion.

When an RFC becomes permanent, it also will be assigned a discussion link.
We'll be using GitHub Issues initially.

Please keep comments brief and to the point.
Contentless opinions such as thumbs up and down or "+1" comments will not have an effect on the outcome of an RFC.

## YAML Specification Process

YAML 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 were specified in one large document.
YAML 1.5 and onwards will be specified as multiple parts including:

* [YAML Syntax EBNF Grammar]()
* [YAML Test Suite]()
* [YAML Language Guide]()
* [YAML DOM Specification]()
* [YAML Schema Specifications]()
* [YAML Implementers Guide]()
* [YAML Spec Change Log]()

## YAML Core Group

The core group driving the new specification process currently consists of:

* [Ingy d√∂t Net](https://github.com/ingydotnet)
* [Tina Mueller](https://github.com/perlpunk)
* [Eemeli Aro](https://github.com/eemeli)
* [Pantelis Antoniou](https://github.com/pantoniou)

They can often be found on IRC at irc.freenode.net#yaml-dev.
