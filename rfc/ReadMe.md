This is a set of RFC Proposals that may be turned into PRs to become official RFCs.

Each RFC has a champion.

Each RFC is added to this branch (rfc-staging) in a single commit.

Changes to an RFC should amend that commit.

Each RFC has a branch named after the RFC.

Each champion should run `git commit --amend --reset-author` to make the commit owned by them.

Each champion should turn their branch into a PR, when it is agreed upon by the team.
