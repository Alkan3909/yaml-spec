YAML Spec RFCs
==============

The planning for the upcoming versions of the YAML Specification is being facilitated by public Request For Comment (RFC) documents.
Currently the YAML core group is working on YAML versions 1.5 and 2.0.
All RFC documents, regardless of their intended target version, will reside in this directory.

RFCs start out as pull requests.
When an RFC pull request is merged to master, it is assigned a permanent RFC #.

The core group has about 50 ideas that are being worked into RFCs.
Anybody can submit an RFC PR, but it might be wise to wait until the initial entries are submitted.

When an RFC becomes permanent, it also will be assigned a discussion link.
We'll be using GitHub Issues initially.

Discussion of an RFC should wait until the RFC becomes permanent.
In other words, it is best to hold off commenting while the RFC is still a PR.

Please keep comments brief and to the point.
Thumbs up and down won't have an effect on the outcome of the RFC or its comments.

## YAML Specification Process

YAML 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 were specified in one large document.
YAML 1.5 and onwards will be specified as multiple parts including:

* [YAML Syntax EBNF Grammar]()
* [YAML Test Suite]()
* [YAML Language Guide]()
* [YAML Implementers Guide]()

## YAML Core Group

The core group driving the new specification process currently consists of:

* [Ingy d√ñt Net](https://github.com/ingydotnet)
* [Tina Mueller](https://github.com/perlpunk)
* [Eemeli Aro](https://github.com/eemeli)
* [Pantelis Antoniou](https://github.com/pantoniou)

They can often be found on IRC at irc.freenode.net#yaml-dev.
