# RFC-013 -- Disallow mixing implicit and explicit mapping style

## Status

Retracted because implementing this would require the dumper to scan every mapping to the end before emitting YAML.

## Problem

Currently, it is possible in a block-style mapping to have both
explicit and implicit key styles:

```yaml
? explicit key
: value
implicit key: value
? another explicit key
: value
```

This is not very readable and looks rather confusing, because as the spec states, leading indicators like `?` and `:` are conceived as part of the indentation.
If we take that seriously, we should have written the mapping above like this:

```yaml
? explicit key
: value
  implicit key: value
? another explicit key
: value
```

## Proposal

However, that produces a syntax error according to the 1.2 spec.
To avoid confusion coming from this layout, this RFC proposes disallowing mixing explicit and implicit key styles in a block-style mapping.

Flow-style mappings do not suffer this problem because matching indentation is not important there.
Also, the mapping is always explicit because it starts with a `{` and therefore, the `?` is always optional.
So it is not necessary to restrict flow-style mappings in the same way.

## Examples

```yaml
# not allowed:
---
? explicit key
: value
implicit key: value
# allowed:
---
- ? explicit key
  : value
- implicit key: value
```
