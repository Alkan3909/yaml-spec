RFC-030 -- Top level nodes are always unindented
================================================

## Status

Proposed for 1.3.

## Problem

It was never really the intention of a YAML document's top level node to be indented at all.
It just came about as a simple way to make the grammar productions be consistent.
To do this in a way that is programmable, there is an implied starting indentation level of -1.
Then a normal top level node is considered "indented" at level 0, which is greater than -1.

This leads to a lot of trouble when talking about YAML indentation or its implication on other rules.

This proposal assumes that there are no (or almost none) important use cases for indenting at the top level.
Also that there is no good reason to do this in the future, and that supporting it makes the language more complicated for no good reason.

### Proposal

YAML should only allow top level nodes that are unindented.

The indentation level counter can be zero, which is what makes sense.
It means "no indentation".

Disallowing top level indentation as a rule should make the language simpler overall.
It should also be easier to implement correctly.

The new grammar will (likely) have a slightly different production for each top level block node.
